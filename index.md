- **Lazarus_4_Kids**<br>
There is a German book >[Delphi f√ºr Kids](https://mitp.de/IT-WEB/fuer-Kids/Delphi-fuer-Kids.html)<. I'm currently checking the book for usage in a after school coding club. The examples of the book are for Delphi(7). As I prefer the open source Free Pascal and Lazarus, I'll try to convert - where necessary - the examples. Find the results in this repository.
